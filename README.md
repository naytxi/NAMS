üñêÔ∏è Hi! I'm Nay and I'm currently learning to code.

<h2> üöÄABOUT </h2>

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to deepen students' understanding of key HTML and CSS elements by researching and presenting on topics including forms, positioning, multimedia integration, and images.

**Instructions:**

 *Divide into Groups:
    
 Each member will focus on a specific topic:
 
        *Forms: Research HTML form elements and CSS styling for forms, including inputs, buttons, checkboxes, and validation.
        
        *Positioning: Explore CSS positioning properties (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) and how they affect element placement on a webpage.
        
        *Multimedia: Investigate how to embed audio and video in HTML, including controls, autoplay..
        
        *Images: Study how to insert and style images in HTML, including attributes like alt, srcset for responsive images, and CSS techniques like object-fit and filter.

*Create Examples:

 Each group will create working examples to demonstrate their topic. These examples should include a sample HTML structure and CSS styling that showcase best practices for their assigned topic.

*Prepare a Presentation:
    
 Summarize the findings and examples in a presentation. Each group will explain their topic, demonstrate code snippets, and share tips and potential challenges they encountered.

*Present and Share:

 Groups will present their research to the class, providing examples and answering questions. Afterward, each group will share their code examples and resources for reference.

 ‚úàÔ∏è Welcome to my journey.
